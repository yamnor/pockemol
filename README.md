## Background

PockeMol was created to address the need for an easy-to-use, shareable molecular visualization tool. By leveraging client-side technologies, it provides a secure and efficient way for chemists, researchers, and students to view and share molecular structures without the need for server-side processing or data storage.

## Key Features

1. **Easy Visualization**: Quickly view 3D molecular structures from XYZ coordinate data.
2. **Data Sharing**: Generate shareable URLs containing molecular structural data.
3. **Server-less Operation**: Works entirely client-side, ensuring data privacy and easy sharing.

## How to Use PockeMol

1. **Data Mode**:

   - Enter XYZ coordinate data for your molecule.
   - The app validates the input to ensure it's proper XYZ data.

2. **View Mode**:

   - Switch to this mode to see a 3D visualization of the molecule.
   - The molecule is rendered using the 3Dmol.js library.

3. **Link Button**:

   - Generate a URL containing the encoded molecular data.
   - The URL is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy sharing.

4. **Info Button**:

   - Access information about the app and its creator.

## Technical Details

### Core Technologies

1. **3Dmol.js**: This JavaScript library is used for molecular visualization, allowing for interactive 3D rendering of molecules.

2. **LZ-String**: This compression library is used to encode and decode molecular data in URLs, enabling efficient data sharing.

### Data Handling

- The app uses URL hash fragments to store and retrieve molecular data.
- Molecular data is compressed and encoded using LZ-String before being added to the URL.
